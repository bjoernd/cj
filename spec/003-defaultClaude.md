# Default CLAUDE.md Creation ✓

## Specification

When setting up, the container environment should get a default CLAUDE.md
for the user. Figure out where to add this. Use the current global CLAUDE.md
as the template.

## Implementation

**Status:** ✓ Completed

**Changes Made:**
- Added `CLAUDE_MD_TEMPLATE` constant to `cjlib/setup.py` based on global CLAUDE.md
- Added `_generate_claude_md()` method to `SetupCommand` class
- Integrated CLAUDE.md creation into setup workflow (only creates if file doesn't exist)
- Added tests: `test_generate_claude_md()`, `test_claude_md_template_content()`, `test_run_creates_claude_md()`, `test_run_does_not_overwrite_existing_claude_md()`
- All tests pass (108 total)
- Linting passes (flake8, black)
